# sebipom
maven project file for use with sebi venlo projects. Split off from statewalker.


Sebi pom has some goodies that make it easy to use features with maven+java without falling into an install fest.
Feature:

* Nicely formatted code in javadoc by a highlighter plugin with configuration
* java coveraga with jacoco
* PIT testing plugin

From now on sebipon will have a repo on its own.
